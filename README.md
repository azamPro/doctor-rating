# Doctor Rating System

Welcome to the Doctor Rating System project! This project allows students to rate and view ratings for different professors based on their subjects. It includes an admin dashboard to monitor the number of students, ratings, and average ratings for each subject.

## Live Demo

You can check out the live demo of the project here: [Doctor Rating System](https://doctor-rating.vercel.app/)

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: The runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the server.
- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **Supabase**: An open-source Firebase alternative that allows us to build scalable applications. We use Supabase for authentication, database management, and API endpoints.
- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript)**: A simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for building custom designs without writing much CSS.
- **Vercel**: A cloud platform for static sites and Serverless Functions, used for deployment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14 or later)
- **NPM** (comes with Node.js) or **Yarn**

3. **Setup Supabase:**

- Create a new project on [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
- Set up your database tables as per the schema required by the project (you can refer to the projectâ€™s SQL scripts for table creation).
- Get your Supabase URL and Anon Key from the project settings
4. **Configure Environment Variables:**
Create a .env file in the root of your project and add the following:
   ```bash
    SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
    SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
    PORT=5000
  ```
Replace your-supabase-url and your-supabase-anon-key with your actual Supabase project URL and anon key.

5. **Running the Project Locally:**
Once you've set up everything, you can start the project locally by running:

   ```bash
    npm start

  ```
